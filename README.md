Hello, I am TJ, a passionate tech junkie who enjoys designing hardware and coding amazing projects for several 
platforms during my free time.

If you find my completed works helpful, feel free to check out my [Patreon](https://patreon.com/tjstyle).

All donations are greatly appreciated, since it would allow me to keep all these projects alive
by covering server expenses, internet bills and afford to upgrade my equipment to work on newer projects.
